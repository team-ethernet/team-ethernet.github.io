# The Team

We are a team of students studying Information and Communication Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. 
We are currently taking the course [II1305 Project in Information and Communication Technology](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/II1305), during which we are conducting a project.

## Internet of Noisy Things
We are developing a noise sensor network for [KTH Network Systems Lab](https://www.kth.se/cos/research/nslab).
The project goal is to design and implement a complete network of noise sensors including
- Input of data from noise sensors.
- Connecting noise sensors in a wireless sensor network.
- Storage and access of sensor data.
- Web interface for accessing and displaying sensor data.

We will also, time permitting
- Investigate server-side support for CoAP pubsub.
- Investigate alternative solutions for noise measurements.
